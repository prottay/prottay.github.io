- A test-infrastructure is proposed that uses low-voltage signals to validate the functionalities of a PMU under test. The test infrastructure is based on National Instrumentsâ€™ cRIO hardware.
- The test-hardware can be easily controlled by a user from the GUI-based software designed in LabVIEW.
- A prototype PMU is put under the tests (using our test-suite) and its performance is analyzed and compared with the others available in literature.
