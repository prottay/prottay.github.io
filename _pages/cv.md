**PMU Pre-compliance test-suite:**

- A test-infrastructure is proposed that uses low-voltage signals to validate the functionalities of a PMU under test. The test infrastructure is based on National Instrumentsâ€™ cRIO hardware.
- The test-hardware can be easily controlled by a user from the GUI-based software designed in LabVIEW.
- A prototype PMU is put under the tests (using our test-suite) and its performance is analyzed and compared with the others available in literature.

**Networking experiments on _Khorjin_ based synchrophasor synchornization gateway:**

 -  cRIO based HW-SW setup to parse, synchronize, timestamp, and display multiple C37.118 streams.  
 -  The PMU streams are corrupted with external networking hardware. 
 -  The network is tampered with delay, data-drip and jitter to test its resillience.


**GFOV investigation in RT for DERs:**

 -  Investigates the presence and effect of Ground Fault Overvoltage (GFOV) phenomenon in Grid-Connected PV inverters. 
 -  Examines whether conventional neutral grounding, which eliminates this GFOV issue in synchronous generators- are necessary for inverter-based systems. 
 -  Tests the effectiveness of SPOV mechanism against GFOV and LROV.
